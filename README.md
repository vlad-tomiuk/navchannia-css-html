# EasyCoding MVP

![Preview](public/preview.png)

This project is an **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product) and still under early-stage development.

The main goal of the app was to simplify writing frequently reused code blocks. While the idea works and the tool is functional, it turned out to be less efficient for my usual workflow. For now, Iâ€™ve decided to freeze active development.
